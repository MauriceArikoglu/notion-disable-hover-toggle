# notion-disable-hover-toggle
Notion's Sidebar can be annoying, when working side by side with other windows. This code inserts a button that allows disabling the edge hover mechanism.

## Installation
- Download Violentmonkey from your browser's extension library: https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/
- Open the Violentmonkey Extension Dashboard
- Click the + Button to add a new Script
- Choose "Install from URL"
- Paste this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MauriceArikoglu/notion-disable-hover-toggle/main/notion-sidebar-disable-hover-toggle-button.js

## Usage
- Click the newly added "Hand" Button in the Notion Topbar to disable the hover-over-edge-to-show-sidebar mechanism
- When disabled the "Hand" turns into a "NoHand"
- Click the "NoHand" Button in the Notion Topbar to enable the hover-over-edge-to-show-sidebar mechanism again
